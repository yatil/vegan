# Vegan (not only) for Web Conference Organizers

## Why am I writing this?

I’ve recently been to the [Fonteers Conference], which is still the most amazing conference on the planet. Or at least in Europe. It was the first time that I went there as somebody who eats vegan stuff only. I submitted a request to the organizers a few weeks before the trip so they could prepare. What I got was all right, but not on par with the other attendees lunch. So I’d like to give some advice to Conference organizer to keep the experience of their conference great for everyone.

## What vegans eat and why salad isn’t enough.

Vegans eat a lot of stuff, but none of it is animal based. That means it is easy to list what we don’t eat: All kinds of meat (yes, that includes fish), cheese, milk and honey. As well as everything made out of those, like yoghurt, or milk sugar or similar things.

As milk and egg products have a huge tradition in western cooking, most cooks and caterings are a bit overwhelmed by vegans and make them a salad.

While those are often really good<sup id="fnr1">[1]</sup>, salads are seldom keeping you from getting hungry for a longer time as they don’t have any proteins. A bit of well prepared (smoked) tofu can really improve this.

## About substitution products.

There’s a lot of meat substitution products, like [mock duck] and others. Don’t use it. Better provide fresh vegetables and tasty (smoked) tofu creations.

But it’s okay to use soy milk, almond milk or oat milk if you got something milk based on your menu<sup id="fnr2">[2]</sup>. There are even so-called “cuisines” on the market, which replace cream.

## How to integrate vegans when it’s time for lunch.

Try to make your vegetarian options vegan by default. For example: if you serve a salad, don’t use cheese as a topping in your buffet. Serve it extra, so vegetarians and [omnivores] can add them to their liking. The same goes for the salad sauce: Chose one without cream.

Give vegans the opportunity to queue in line<sup id="fnr3">[3]</sup> like everyone else. Serve rice or noodles seperate if possible to give them a chance to grab some of it. And remember that it can spoil the whole food for someone when meat sauce drips into the noodles that otherwise would have been veg(etari)an.

## What informations do vegans (and others) help to get around.

That is important for even more people, especially for people with food allergies:

* Get a list of every food option as served on that day and a detailed list of ingredients online, at least one week before the conference.
* Mark the food option as vegan or vegetarian and note if they contain lactose, gluten or nuts. Do this online as well as directly on the buffet.

    <li id="fn3">Waiting on the side while everyone else is chatting and making connections can break the conference experience for some, at least if they are at the conference for the first time and don’t know anybody.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr3"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.">&#8617;</a></li>

# Vegan (not only) for Web Conference Organizers

## Why am I writing this?

I’ve reacently been to the Fonteers Conference, which is still the most amazing conference on the planet. Or at least in Europe. It was the first time that I went there as somebody who eats vegan stuff only. I submitted a request to the organizers a few weeks before the trip so they could prepare. What I got was all right, but not on par with the other attendees lunch. So I’d like to give some advice to Conference organizer to keep the experience of their conference great for everyone.

## What vegans eat and why salad isn’t enough.

Vegans eat a lot of stuff, but none of it is animal based. That means it is easy to list what we don’t eat: All kinds of meat (yes, that includes fish), cheese, milk and honey. As well as everything made out of those, like yoghurt, or milk sugar or similar things.

As milk and egg products have a huge tradition in traditional cooking, most cooks and caterings are a bit overwhelmed by vegans and make them a salad.

While those are often really good<sup id="fnr1-2012-10-10">[1]</sup>, salads are seldom keeping you from getting hungry as they don’t have any proteins. A bit of well prepared (smoked) tofu can really improve this.
